# -------------------------------------  EXAMPLE ONE -------------------------------------------------
# Practice 1: Write a `print()` statement that outputs "Hello, World!" to the console.
print("Hello, World!")
# Practice 2: Write another `print()` statement that outputs "Python is an easy Programming language" to the console.
print("Python is an easy Programming language")

print(" ")
# -------------------------------------  EXAMPLE TWO -------------------------------------------------
# Practice 3: Create a variable called `message` and assign the string "Good Morning!" to it.
message = "Good Morning!"
# Practice 4: Print the value stored in the `message` variable to the console using `print()`.
print(message)

print(" ")
# -------------------------------------  EXAMPLE THREE -------------------------------------------------
# Practice 5: Create a variable called `day` and assign it the string '09' to represent the day.
day = '09'
# Practice 6: Print the value of `day`, but prevent it from moving to a new line after printing.
print(day, end='-')
# Practice 7: Create a variable `month` and assign it the value "October". Print `month` with `end='-'` so it stays on the same line.
month = 'October'
print(month, end='-')
# Practice 8: Create a variable `year` and assign it the value `2024`. Print `year` without adding a newline at the end.
year = 2024
print(year)
print(" ")
# -------------------------------------  EXAMPLE FOUR -------------------------------------------------
# Practice 9: Create two variables: `age` and `name`. Assign `age` the value `25` and `name` the string `"John"`.
name = "John"
age = 25
# Practice 10: Print the values of `age` and `name` using just one print() function.
print(name, age)


# -------------------------------------  EXAMPLE FIVE -------------------------------------------------
# Practice 11: Create three variables: `color`, `animal`, and `fruit`. Assign them the values `"Blue"`, `"Elephant"`, and `"Apple"` respectively.
color = "Blue"
animal = "Elephant"
fruit = "Apple"

print(" ")
# Practice 12: Use `print()` to display a message that includes "The color is:", followed by the value of `color`, 
# "The animal is:", followed by the value of `animal`, and "The fruit is:", followed by the value of `fruit`.

print("The color is:",color,", The animal is:", animal,", The fruit is:", fruit)

# -------------------------------------  EXAMPLE SIX -------------------------------------------------
# Practice 13: Create three variables: `university`, `faculty`, and `id`. Assign `"Jaamacada Ummadda"`, `"Science"`, and `"12345"` to them.
university = "Jaamacada Ummadda"
faculty = "Science"
Id = "B5Sc1130"
print(" ")
# Practice 14: Print the value of `university`, followed by `faculty`, and `id`, using newline characters `\n` between them to print each on a separate line.

print('University:', university, '\nFaculty:', faculty, '\nStudent Id:', Id)
